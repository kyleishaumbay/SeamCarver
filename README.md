# SeamCarver
The Seam Carver project is a Python-based implementation of the seam carving technique for content-aware image resizing. By identifying and removing low-energy seams, this method reduces an imageâ€™s size while preserving important visual content. The project leverages dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the energy of each pixel and remove the vertical or horizontal seams with the least energy.
